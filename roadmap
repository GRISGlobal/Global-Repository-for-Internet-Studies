We've designed a common platform that encourages learning, creation, contribution, connecting and sharing of Internet issues while addressing local based Internet issues.
________________________________________
The Global Repository Website allows you to access information including opportunities for young and adult users. It also allows users to report threatening issues including cybersecurity, fake news, fake images among other for verification and further checks by the GRIS Team in charge of #Report2Gris, an initiative combating internet related issues. 
To help you to see what you can do with the website, visit www. grisglobal.org. Our Library section focuses on e-learning opportunities for users while introducing new users to what they can learn at a grasp on the internet.
Ultimately we also provide links to data, publications, blogs, and more associated with all Internet related issues by country, region and community based search. The goal is to ensure that our users are able to contribute to help make GRIS the go-to-platform for all Internet related solution from cybersecurity tips to both free and paid courses on coding, marketing, etc.

We're working on updating our repo while adding concrete milestones, so be patient with us!!
